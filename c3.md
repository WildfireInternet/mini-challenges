Twitter App
============
Story
-------
Tweetdec and several other services have made following multiple twitter trends, but we want to build a really simple way to do this, without having to setup your account or anything. Just a place where you can quickly create lists of hash tags to follow and to be able to see them all at once.

Actions
---------
(Create lists that auto update with a given keyword)
0. quick plan / sketch
    - a design with the lists each maybe about 300px in width, listing iown, but then have lists next to each other, maybe something like this: and have a side scrollbar?
    
    [ + Add List ]

1. create structure html/css (hardcode in a couple lists with a couple demo tweets in each)
    - Think about the structure a bit for your design
    - No need for real tweets yet, just some dummy ones, you'll need there twitter handle and the text.
    - Make sure your CSS can cope with loads of lists, e.g. what if we had 50 lists? Would it scroll to the side, or fall down, or just fail?
2. javascript to request the latest tweets for each of the lists
    - You'll need to research using jQuery ajax/getJson to get a list of tweets for a given hash tag
    - Try to avoid using a pre-built plugin for this, Its much more flexible to just request the twitter api, search for the hash tag, and have it return an object with all the tweets in. Then  with that you can loop over each tweet and insert them as list items in the exact structure you want :).
    - create a function that takes in a hash tag, and prints out a list to the page (the same structure as your hardcoded ones)
3. add ability to create lists with a form and javascript
    - This form needs to not submit properly, but rather just on submit it needs to take the hash tag given, and run it through the function above, adding another list to the page
4. store the lists with local-storage
    - Store the requested lists so when the user comes
5. Now we have a way to store them we will need a way to delete them
    - Add a function on the page which deletes a given list, and deletes it from local-storage too!
    - add links to the top of each list for quick deleting
