FAQ system 
===========
Story
-------
The client (Timmy's Tools), wants to have a page on his site he can easy admin himself which shows frequently asked questions and answers.

Actions
---------
0. quick plan / sketch
    - the front end
        - list of questions, and on click show the answer.
    - the back end (don't worry about the security for now)
        - list of questions with links to edit and delete each
        - link to add question page
1. html / css version to build up the structure
    - hard code a front end version with a couple questions
2. javascript to make answers sections expand / collapse
    - make sure only one answer shown at a time
3. mysql base
    - First create a database in phpmyadmin for this app
    - create a table called "questions" to store the faq in
        - Table should have the following columns:
            id -> Int field thats the primary key and auto increments
            question -> varchar field about 300 characters max?
            answer -> text field
        - still using phpmyadmin for now, insert a couple questions in for testing
4. php with mysql (frontend app)
    - The create a php file which you will include for all your other php files in this project which connects to that database (i advise you use php PDO)
    - change your index.html file (from step 1) to a php file
    - include the db connection file
    - select all the questions from the database, and loop them to the page in place of the hardcoded versions already in.
5. more php and mysql (now for the backend app)
    - Create a directory called "admin/"
    - create 4 files inside, add.php, edit.php, delete.php and list.php
    - First the list.php file (from the original mockup) listing out questions
    - Next add.php, create a form on here that simple inserts a question
    - edit.php, take the form from add.php and mod it so that it updates instead and has the current values as dfaults in the inputs. This file needs to take an id of the question in the url
    - delete.php needs to just take an id of a question in the url, delete it with mysql, and redirect back to the list.php file
    - test that as you add/update/delete on this backend app, its updating on the front end app :)
6. Security, currently, anyone can just go to the site /admin/list.php and edit your faq, so here we need to implement a simple login screen.
    - each admin file should make sure sessions are on, and that the session for this user exists
        - if not redirect to the login.php file
    - create login.php file, which is just another form with email and password inputs, that on post needs to check if its equal to a hardcoded variable of the admin email and password (we only have a single person admining this site so no need for a much more complex login system). If equal then set a session var to say they are logged in.
