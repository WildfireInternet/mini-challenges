Contact Form
=============
Story
-------
The client (Big Bobs Oil) needs a new page on his site form a contact form. Create a quick page for contacting him with a form to take users Name, Email and a larger field to take there message.
He already has a nice designed site, but don't worry about his design, just build the main features of the page and his son will be adapting this into his actual site later.

Actions
---------
0. quick sketch
    - Simple layout with the form nicely displayed as the main feature
1. html / css
    - Think a little about the structure of your form, how the inputs would be best structured
    - and on the style side, it would be nice if the fields and labels lined up per line
2. javascript validation
    - all the fields need to be filled in
    - and the email field needs to be an email address
3. php file to send
    - Check to make sure the fields are set
    - Send via the php mail() function
    - redirect back to the contact form page
4. send form via ajax, show response on page
    - Modify the contact page to submit the form via ajax (but dont break it for non js users)
    - Modify the php script to detect if its an ajax post and if so, dont redirect, instead just print out the response as "Thanks for contacting us".
