Mobile App (Phonegap)
======================
Story
-------
The twitter app from the last project is taking off a bit, but people really want a mobile app for it.

Actions
---------
0. quick plan / sketch
    - Maybe just show one list at a time, but have a way to scroll / swipe between lists
1. take your twitter app, and make it more responsive
    - Simple things like pixels to em's and percentages, and a good meta viewport maybe, just testing in the mobile browser
    - Cange the display to match your new sketch, so if you've gone with the swipe motion to scroll between lists, you'll need to look into how to scroll the outer container of all the lists left and right with touch events, and maybe how to lock between scroll points, as on mobile you may want it to auto scroll after half way so it aligns properly, this could prove a little complex but should be worth it :)
2. how about if the device goes offline? 
    - Modify the javascript to wait for the device to be connected to the internet before requesting from twitter, and pop a message to the user to let them know they are offline and tweets will return once connected.
3. upload to phonegap and build for android or another device and test.
